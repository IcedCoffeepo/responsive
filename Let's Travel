<p class="paragrap"> Hi I'm Rosa, I am a IT student at DLL or Dalubhasaan ng Lungsod ng Lucena! Welcome to my blog! So in this blog I will tell you a little about myself. So hi again! haha! my name is Rosalinda P Dimaano, I am 22 years old and yes I am 22 and still in second year college, so the story behind it is I shifted course from being a nursing student to IT student haha! its like from parts of the human body to computer parts real quick! To be honest its not hard for me to adjust because I already have a background in technology and im enjoying it now, I think that would be all, THANK YOOUUU!!
